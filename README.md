# Alphashots-AI-Prediction Model

**Overview:**
This project leverages the AlphaShots AI Prediction Model, a machine learning framework designed to analyze and predict patterns in a given dataset. By employing advanced algorithms and leveraging tools provided in a collaborative Google Colab notebook, this project demonstrates the ability to predict outcomes based on historical data and input features.

**Objective:**
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurate forecasts using structured datasets. This project highlights the importance of predictive analytics in applications such as market trends, sports performance, or healthcare outcomes, depending on the dataset used.

**Key Features:**

**1. Dataset Preparation:**

Load the dataset into the Colab environment.
Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature encoding.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Use visualizations to explore data trends, outliers, and correlations.
Extract key insights into the dataset to guide model development.

**3. Model Development:**

Train an AI model using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.
